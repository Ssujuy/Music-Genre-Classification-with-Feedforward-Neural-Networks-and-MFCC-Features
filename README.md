# Music-Genre-Classification-with-Feedforward-Neural-Networks-and-MFCC-Features
This project develops a feedforward neural network to classify music genres using MFCC features. It includes data loading, label mapping, and setting up PyTorch dataloaders for training, validation, and testing, aiming to distinguish genres like classical, hip-hop, rock, and blues.
